TRM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1936, the Transamur Republic is a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to the Japanese Empire. And yet Admiral Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"

tram.intro.t:0 "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d:0 "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the most successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925.\n\nIn 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"

tram.intro.c:0 "Tell me more about Japanese Delegation"

tram.999.t:0 "The Oblastniki - Siberian Regionalists"
tram.999.d:0 "The Siberian regionalism is a political movement to form an autonomous Siberia. Firstly developed in the 19th century by Siberian students, it gained huge popularity during the Russian Civil War with the creation of the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. However, the Provisional Siberian Government sacrificed own independence for the sake of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks.\n\nDuring the rule of Kerensky, though Russia was stated as a federative republic, President has continuosly blocked all resolutions about giving wider autonomy to Siberia and it is still an undeveloped region.\n\nWhile the majority of the Siberia is under control of the Petrograd Regime, most of the Oblastniks, both leftist and rightist have support their former ally - Admiral Kolchak in the putsch as he promised wide autonomy to Siberia and he even invited a prominent Oblastnik - Pyotr Vologodsky to become a prime-minister.\n\nIn 1936 they are still waiting for Kolchak to finally unite Russia under his rule and proclaim Siberian Autonomy. Their resistance increases with their popularity and if it is high enough they can even attempt to overthrow Kolchak."

tram.998.t:0 "The Japanese Business Interests in Transamur"
tram.998.d:0 "The Japanese Empire has a huge influence on our country - they were the ones that intervened in the Far-East during the Russian Civil War and expanded their influence in the Transamur Region. In 1922 an independent nation was formed in Vladivostok, supported by local business community. However, everything changed, when in 1925 Kolchak tried to coup the Russian government and was forced to flee to Transamur, supported by Oblastniki and Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nFinding himself in a partially-recognized state with only ally, Kolchak has nothing to do but establish even stronger economic ties with the Japanese Empire. While formally Transamur is independent, Japanese has a free military access to our territory and provide us with supplies. Our dependence on Japan varies proportionally with the popularity of the Japanese Delegation. If their influence becomes too high, they will try to establish full control over our country."

tram.21.d:0 "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region.

tram.25.t:0 "Reds Purge in the Russian Far East"
tram.25.d:0 "The new-established socialist regime in Western Russia has shown that it is too weak to control areas distant from its urban heartland. Our troops have successfully seized the Russian Far East from them, purging what little influence they held in the region."

tram.26.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Cede the Far-East"
tram.26.d:0 "It appears that although the illegitimate Russian regime recognises our efforts to seize control of Siberia they have refused to withdraw their forces and allow the region to fall into our hands.

tram.42.t:0 "Transamurian Expansion in Siberia"

tram.48.b:0 "Who they think they are?"

tram.49.t:0 "Transamur Submits"
tram.49.d:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] has decided to submit and kneel before us. Now, there is an empty office of the Vladivostok governorship, and so we shall find a replacement. There are several available options: Ataman Semyenov, leader of Transbaikal Cossack Host. A content Cossack ataman, he would be unlikely to cause serious problems. There is also the choice of the General Yui Mitsue who once was in command of Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. An old man deserving of a proper retirement, rule in Transamur would be a good fit for him. Still, several liberal ministers have been suggesting that we should establish a new democratic regime in Transamur instead."
tram.49.a:0 "General Mitsue, you have a new order."
tram.49.b:0 "This Wojciechowski knows how to rule the people."

tram.56.t:0 "A Rival Government"
tram.56.d:0 "If the government of Kerenskiy is said to be fairly elected, the new Russian Government is as legitimate as we are.

tram.67.t:0 "Transamur Attempts to Break Free"
tram.67.d:0 "With the recent reconquest of Siberia by Transamur they have become much bolder, trying to forge their own way under the sun. Recently they have moved their capital from Vladivostok to more remote parts of their republic, a clear attempt to minimise our influence. What shall we do?"

A number of Japanese loyalists and toadies in the Vladivostok Duma have already called for the direct integration of our country into Japan, becoming a new prefecture of the Empire.

Their miserable rump state is at war with Japan and they assuredly have no chance of victory in the face of Japanese military power. Representatives from Transamur have come to us begging us peacefully rejoin our nation, presumably in the hopes of avoiding conquest by Japan.

It appears that rebels sought to kill Alexander Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, but their best efforts seem to have come to nothing, with the putsch crushed by loyalist guards. Still, Kolchak has made a number of enemies in Transamur and his vulnerability is becoming increasingly clear.

But even now lots of the Russians live there and play a significant role in the railway. Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not. Our Economic Minister has proposed that we should make an agreement with Fengtian, which will allow the usage of the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, but will permit additional taxation by the Fengtian Government."

The government in Vladivostok says that we will be able to tax these transactions, moreover such an agreement could have a positive influence the industrial development of the city as well as the region, where the local Russian business started to make various investments. But, some members of our government mention that the free use of the Transamurian Ruble can lead to the increase of Harbin's autonomy."

trammlad.147.t:0 "The Union of Mladorossi"
trammlad.147.d:0 "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazmbek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazmbek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazmbek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazmbek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazmbek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazmbek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazmbek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazmbek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\n\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazmbek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia."

Formed in 1931 by local politician and staunch Kolchak loyalist, Konstantin Rodzaevsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Rodzaevsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

But, Kazmbek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazmbek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power.

These titans of men represent the strength required to restore the Russian Tsardom, but these men are no elitist sycophants that have previously stood behind a Tsar. The Blueshirts are composed of rugged working-class proletariat workers who have evolved out of the brawls in the streets of Vladivostok and into disciplined soldiers waving the banner of Russia and the Mladorossi.

Alexander Kazem-Bek held within him a fiery passion that struck a light in the minds and souls of working patriots across the Russian lands. He rejected the spiralling crash brought upon by bickering factions of lifeless hordes eager to tear eachother apart in the name of power and greed! Kazem-Bek rallied those fellow brave nationalists and together they defeated the enemy within! Russia has ascended beyond its stagnant state, no longer the sickman of the globe. The heart of Russia is the heart of the Mladorossi, the movement has become Russia’s new identity. And as Kazem-Bek’s fearsome rhetoric grows ever more dominant over the minds of many, so does Russia.

TRM_Navy_Start_desc:0 "Vladivostok was both a major port and city in the Russian Far East under the old Tsarist regime, but with the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war, Vladivostok has lost some of its importance.

TRM_Navy_Old_Ways_desc:0 "A lot of time has passed since the end of the Weltkrieg. Naval thought has changed and new technologies such as carriers and submarines have experienced much development.

TRM_Navy_Cruiser:0 "Develop Cruisers"
TRM_Navy_Cruiser_desc:0 "We are not ready to construct big battleships, so it would be wise to focus on smaller ships such as cruisers. They are one of the keys to naval domination and a worthy initial goal for our fleet."

TRM_Navy_DD:0 "Destroyers of Amur"
TRM_Navy_DD_desc:0 "Destroyers are small fast ships which are produced to escort trade convoys and bigger ships. Although they aren't the pinnacle of warships in terms of tonnage and power we cannot afford to ignore them."

TRM_Navy_New_Ways_desc:0 "The rise of submarines and carriers during the Weltkrieg was unexpected. They have since proven themselves to be very effective. Though we will likely still rely on our extant main fleet, perhaps we could augment it with these new types of ships?"

TRM_Navy_Carrier:0 "Pacific Carriers"

TRM_Ind_Vlad_desc:0 "Kolchak's autocratic government did almost nothing to develop our country at all during the 1920's.

Even if our progress is slow, incremental improvements will result in a prosperous country some day."

TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv1:0 "Minor Japanese Investment"
TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv1_desc:0 "It may be a bitter pill, but we cannot develop without foreign investments. Japan is unfortunately the only country with the will and capability to invest in our economy, however this will inevitably upset our people."

TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv2:0 "Major Japanese Investment"
TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv2_desc:0 "We need more! Japan is willing to invest even more capital and industrial development in Transamur. There are concerns in our administration that our nation will become increasingly dependent on the Empire if we go down such a path. We must find a balance."

TRM_Ind_Mon:0 "Develop Chita"
TRM_Ind_Mon_desc:0 "These lands are in a very poor condition after decades of neglect by the corrupt Russian leadership. It will take us a long time to build up this region, but we can begin now."

TRM_Ind_Transsib_exp:0 "Improve Supply Network"
TRM_Ind_Transsib_exp_desc:0 "As more of Trans-Siberian railway become part of our country its usefulness becomes increasingly apparent. We now even have the potential to create a nationwide railway supply system to deliver goods all across the country."

TRM_Ind_West_Sib_desc:0 "Western Siberia is our primary strategic region because it allows us to directly attack the traitors from Petrograd. A lot of new facilities must be build to make us stronger before the final battle"

TRM_Ind_Caucasus:0 "Improving the Caucasus"
TRM_Ind_Caucasus_desc:0 "The lands of the caucasus are rich with oil which is why Germany wanted to have a tight grip on the area. With the region under our control we can improve the industry for the people who have long suffered."

TRM_Ind_POL:0 "Appeasing the Polish"
TRM_Ind_POL_desc:0 "The Poles are a rebellious people and therefore must be tamed rather than crushed. We can extend our industrial project to the region to give them the aid they desire."

TRM_Ind_BLT:0 "Expanding The Baltic"

TRM_Trade_Jap:0 "Improve Trade Relations With Japan"
TRM_Trade_Jap_desc:0 "We may hate the Japanese but even the blind can appreciate that we depend on their economy. It would be more than wise to improve our trade relations with the Empire."

TRM_Jap_Inv1:0 "Aid from Japan"
TRM_Jap_Inv1_desc:0 "We can ask Japan to invest some money into our industry. It will allow us to develop our country faster. However, the deepening ties between us will also grow increasingly apparent, which means our people will be displeased."

TRM_Jap_Inv2:0 "Zaibatsu Investments"
TRM_Jap_Inv2_desc:0 "The Japanese industrial giants are increasingly coming to see us as a useful market for their goods. However, by requesting further financial investment from them the people of Transamur will no doubt disapprove of our cosying up to Tokyo."

TRM_Co_Prosper_With_Japan:0 "Co-Prosper With Japan"
TRM_Co_Prosper_With_Japan_desc:0 "While it’s true that Japan has given us much, it doesn’t mean we need to give up our independence. We have to keep our close ties with them as partners, not servants."

TRM_Jap_Inv3:0 "Invite Japanese Instructors"
TRM_Jap_Inv3_desc:0 "While Japanese aid and investment has been highly lucrative, our economy is laughably inefficient compared to that of the land of the rising sun. We should ask our friends to the east for economic advisers and request the personal assistance of Japanese industrialists. Such a move could lead to massive unrest among our people, however; these instructors may be perceived as colonists."

TRM_Jap_Naval_Treaty:0 "Russo-Japanese Naval Treaty"
TRM_Jap_Naval_Treaty_desc:0 "As we become closer to Japan, they are willing to sign a treaty with us which would allow us to coordinate with Japanese scientists to develop naval doctrines. However, it will probably anger our people who hate Japanese imperialists."

TRM_Jap_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Our navy is reaping great rewards from our cordiality with Japan, which has become increasingly pronounced due to our recent naval joint-development effort.

TRM_Feng_Dip:0 "Draw Closer to Fengtian"
TRM_Feng_Dip_desc:0 "The Fengtian regime is also under a great deal of Japanese influence, and thus our ally. Despite this and our close geographic proximity, our nation has diplomatic and economic ties comparable to that of any other with Fengtian.

TRM_Feng_Workforce:0 "Invite Fengtian Workers"
TRM_Feng_Workforce_desc:0 "To the west lie the vast lands of Manchuria ruled by Zhang Zuolin who is our occasional partner and ally. A lot of poor Chinese people are willing to work for us, even for a mere bowl of rice per day. Cheap labour could help us greatly, but Japanese officials would no doubt use them to increase their influence in our politics."

TRM_Feng_Smugglers:0 "Smuggle Weapons From Triads"
TRM_Feng_Smugglers_desc:0 "Permanent instability in Asia creates good conditions for various smugglers and other criminals. As we need weapons to fight, we'll get it from every possible source.

TRM_Arm_Inf2:0 "Northern Expansion"
TRM_Arm_Inf2_desc:0 "Our nation is exhausted of fighting men, and our current drafting rate appears to be insufficient to populate our armed forces. If we enact conscription by requirement, we will have more troops to fight against our enemies."

TRM_Air_Bases_Vlad_desc:0 "Our nation has been left behind by the aerial revolution without a single air field to our name. Since the Weltkrieg aircraft have become a very deadly weapon of war and as such we must possess them. Without air bases even the biggest air force would be useless."

TRM_Air_Bases_Irk:0 "Irkutsk Strips"

TRM_Kolchak_Purge:0 "Purge the Army"
TRM_Kolchak_Purge_desc:0 "To avoid any further coups and rebellions the whole apparatus of military high command must be inspected. However, these harsh measures will disrupt the capabilities of our army for some time."

TRM_Deal_With_Oblastniki:0 "Deal with Oblastniki"
TRM_Deal_With_Oblastniki_desc:0 "The Oblastniki have been a lump in the throat of Kolchak's State for a long time now. When Kolchak became a leader of Transamur, he promised a wide autonomy to Siberia as soon as it will be controlled by Kolchak's White Guard. The moment has come. Though Kolchak knows about his promises, the Oblastniki are the ones that support liberals and socialists - our main enemies. Now, when Kolchak has consolidated the power in his hands, nothing can stop him from crushing the opposing Siberian federalists."

TRM_Crush_NRA:0 "Crush the NRA"
TRM_Crush_NRA_desc:0 "The People's Revolutionary Army is the main threat to the existence of our country.

TRM_Kolchak_Doc:0 "Supreme Ruler"
TRM_Kolchak_Doc_desc:0 "Kolchak claims himself to be the "Supreme Ruler of Russia". For our leader to bolster his image, he needs a strong propaganda machine to help foster an effective cult of personality. Everyone should know about his glorious persona and great deeds. Kolchak must be seen as Father of the Nation in the eyes of his people."

TRM_Mil_Inf:0 "Buy Modern Equipment"
TRM_Mil_Inf_desc:0 "Our equipment is obsolete and so we must turn to the global market. Perhaps we will even be able to acquire blueprints so we can produce new equipment of our own."

TRM_Mil_ML_End:0 "Political Stabilisation"
TRM_Mil_ML_End_desc:0 "The situation has finally stabilised. Nobody can argue against our legitimacy, our borders are protected by a strong and modern army. People have learnt how to be modest and not to waste their money and efforts on nonsensical things. Order has finally returned to Transamur."

He was the one who supported liberalism and democracy in Transamur and the one who prevented Kolchak from too authocratic reforms. Now, when the democracy is restored, the KDV is likely to make Transamur the second Asian economy after Japan."

TRM_NDS:0 "The NDS Elected"
TRM_NDS_desc:0 "The NDS or Zemchane is the party, led by Spiridon Merkulov. It unites wealthy Russian businessmen and landlords.
